# Booking app

This project is in progress. Stay tuned.

## Overview

The idea behind this project is to book a schedule, whether an interview, limo, make a dentist appointment.

### Idea

Idea behind this app is to build something like Calendly, but not to copy-paste it.
In the end I want it to be flexible to fit specific client's needs, like I said - recruiter, dentist, photographers.

### Design

Visual representation is my own, which will be styled to completion after functionalities are done.
On the other hand, there isn't much wiggle room to make a calendar.

### Features

Currently there is a calendar.
If you click a day from previous or next month, you will change the calendar to that month.
If you click a date in the current month, a popup modal will appear for that date.
On the right-hand side of the popup modal you can select the time you want to make a schedule.
On the left-hand side you enter your contact information and after you've filled required fields and picked a time, you can make an appointment.

I will update this section daily

## Technology

This app is made in React using functional components. 
For state management I am using React's Context API.
Components are built using styled-components.

This section will be updated when needed.
